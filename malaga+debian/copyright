This package is one of the four Debian binary packages that contain
Malaga version 4.3.  The four packages are malaga-bin, libmalaga2,
libmalaga-dev and malaga-doc.

The four packages were debianized by Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho
<gaia@iki.fi>.  The upstream sources were obtained from
<URL:ftp://ftp.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/pub/malaga/malaga-4.3.tar.gz>
on December 20, 1999.  Only minor modifications were made to the
upstream Makefile to facilitate proper building of the shared and
static libraries, and some portability fixes were made to the source.
These changes are documented with proper comments in the source
package.
