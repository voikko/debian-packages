malaga (6.13-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules (strip_lib): Remove .comment sections too.
  * debian/control (Build-Depends): Require tetex-extra too; this is needed for
  kpathsea to build the lcircle10 font, which is in turn needed for dvi2pdf,
  all of which when you use @cartouche in the texinfo source.  Closes: #266280.

  * rules (binary-doc): And put them in the package.
  * control (malaga-doc Recommends): Suggest ghostview as a postscript-viewer.

  a real virtual package.  Also recommend xpdf | pdf-viewer.
  (malaga-bin Recommends): It's info-browser, not info-viewer; and suggest info
  as a possibility.
  
 -- Thomas Bushnell, BSG <tb@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Aug 2004 00:25:06 -0700

malaga (4.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  * source/malmake.c: Removed note about Debian-specific changes,
    as there are none.  This file is now pristine.
  * debian/copyright: GPL is in /usr/share.
  * bin-README.Debian: There are no longer any differences between
    upstream and Debian Emacs keybindings, so removed that note.

malaga (4.2.5p1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * malaga.el: Change keybindings for malaga-mode so that
    C-c LETTER is changed into C-c C-LETTER.  This fix is in the

  * source/libmatrix.c: merged in hangul guards and Tk 8 support from
    the unreleased 4.3 tree.

malaga (4.2.5p1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Reinstated the library packages. The problem turned out to
    be fixable after all.
  * I feel stupid.

 -- Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <ajk@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Jun 1999 22:39:24 +0300

malaga (4.2.5p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Dropped the packages libmalaga1 and libmalaga-dev due
    to unfixable libc conflicts.  The packages may be reinstated
    after a new upstream version.  Fixes build problems on glibc2.1
    systems.

 -- Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <ajk@debian.org>  Wed, 26 May 1999 17:46:31 +0300

malaga (4.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * The header files basic.h, source/pools.h and values.h
    are now installed into /usr/include/malaga.  Together with
    the libmalaga-dev README.Debian, this addresses bug #32533.
  * libmalaga-dev: Added a README.Debian explaining the situation
    with the header files.
  * malaga-bin: Renamed README.debian to README.Debian.
  * source/transmit_process.c: Kluged around the fact that GNU libc
    version 2 defines index () in <string.h>.  I'm informing upstream
    about this.

 -- Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <ajk@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Jan 1999 16:35:32 +0200

malaga (4.2.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * malaga-bin suggested libmalaga1-dev, which was renamed to
    libmalaga-dev.  Corrected this.

 -- Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <ajk@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jan 1999 01:07:07 +0200

malaga (4.2.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated maintainer address.
  * Updated the short descriptions.  "Automatic language analysis" is
    much more succinct than "left-associative grammars", and it's much
    more understandable to us Earthers (as opposed to linguists :-), too.
  * The series of mistakes continue.  Include libmalaga.h, not
    malaga_lib.h in the -dev package.
  * Added the home page URL to README.Debian.
  * malaga-doc: Registered the HTML documentation to doc-base.
  * malaga-doc: fixed the HTML docs build.  Images were not generated
    because of a typo in debian/rules.

 -- Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <ajk@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Jan 1999 14:08:21 +0200

malaga (4.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source.
  * Bumped standards version to 2.5.0.0.  No changes were needed.
  * Mmmh.  I hadn't changed the suggests and recommend as I claim below
    having done.  Added emacsen to suggests of malaga-bin, and lyx & gv
    to malaga-doc recommends.
  * Renamed libmalaga1-dev to libmalaga-dev, made the new dev package
    depend on the exact version of the lib package, and made the lib package
    and the new dev package conflict with the old dev package.
  * Updated debian/copyright.
  * Removed the shlibs files in debian/ - the shlibs file that gets used is
    created on the fly by debian/rules.
  * Added an Emacs startup script.
  * Upstream had adopted my manpages but moved them to a different location.
    Updated debian/rules accordingly.
  * De-bashismed the postinst.  Thanks, lintian.

 -- Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <gaia@iki.fi>  Sun, 20 Dec 1998 22:00:45 +0200

malaga (4.2.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * malaga.el /does/ work with xemacsen.  Changed suggests appropriately.
  * Added real packages to malaga-doc recommends; previously there were
    only virtual packages.
  * Made `debian/rules clean' clean /all/ backup files.  My last try (-2)
    was quite unsuccessful.

 -- Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <gaia@iki.fi>  Tue,  3 Nov 1998 19:36:03 +0200

malaga (4.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backups of the new man pages weren't cleaned. Embarrassing.

malaga (4.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * New upstream source.
  * 4.2-1 was never uploaded anywhere.
  * libmatrix was not --strip-unneeded'ed.  Thanks, lintian.
	
 -- Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <gaia@iki.fi>  Tue, 27 Oct 1998 01:27:05 +0200

malaga (4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial revision.
  * Wrote manpages for the binaries.
  * When building, malmake is not in the path (grammars/Makefile).
  * malmake.c needs <sys/types.h> for pid_t, contrary to what the
    manpage for fork(2) says.
  * Removed MALAGA_DISPLAY, since this is the simplest way to make
    malaga conform to policy (no environment variables may be needed
    for normal operation) without breaking anything. (display_process.c,
    tcl/display.tcl).
  * Numerous changes to the upstream source/Makefile to conform to
    Debian policy.  See the comments on the file.
  * Gave libmalaga the soname libmalaga.so.1.
