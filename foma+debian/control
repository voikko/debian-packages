Description: Xerox-compatible finite-state compiler
 Foma is a compiler, programming language, and C library for constructing
 finite-state automata and transducers for various uses. It has specific
 support for many natural language processing applications such as producing
 morphological analyzers. Although NLP applications are probably the main use
 of foma, it is sufficiently generic to use for a large number of purposes.
